  -=================-
    RdvZ TODO list.
 version 2.0 alpha 2010/02/23
  -=================-

** The current version is still an alpha : there is no user documentation nor
built-in installer, although it will come rather quickly I hope. Developper
documentation will arrive soon too, and you can already read code comments. **
 

None of the following items are in any order of importance or difficulty.
Where possible, related items have been grouped together.

Before implementing any of these, we suggest that you ask about it (them)
on the mailing list <gpl@univ-avignon.fr>.

Future features.
  - writing meetings in the diary.
  - defining specific meetings (ex : weekly meeting).
