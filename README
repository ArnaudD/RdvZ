Bug tracker : https://sourcesup.cru.fr/tracker/?atid=2113&group_id=586&func=browse
Developper contact : romain.deveaud@univ-avignon.fr


** Disclaimer :
The current version is still an alpha : there is no user documentation nor
built-in installer, although it will come rather quickly I hope. Developper
documentation will arrive soon too, and you can already read code comments.



1. Introduction

RdvZ is a web application developed by the Université d’Avignon et des Pays 
de Vaucluse which allows to create and manage meetings and to poll potential 
attendee avalibility. The application allows both anonymous and authenticated 
access (it can be either with Database or with a CAS server + LDAP or with a 
LDAP server alone), but whatever the access mode, everybody is able to vote 
without being authenticated.



2. Licence

See the LICENSE file.



3. Requirements

3.1. Web Server requirements
RdvZ is developped with the web framework symfony and is based on a LAMP
architecture (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), so you need to setup a web server 
in order to run RdvZ. 

Websites to check :
 - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP if you are running Ubuntu, 
 - http://wiki.debian.org/LaMp if you are running Debian,
 - http://www.lamphowto.com/ if you need further help.

Of course MySQL is not required, you can use for example PostgreSQL, Oracle...

3.2. Symfony requirements
The symfony version used for RdvZ is symfony1.3. It requires :
 - PHP >= 5.2.4, but ideally not 5.2.9

It also requires some optional things, if you want to perform a clean install
you may want to check it, do :
 $ wget http://sf-to.org/1.4/check.php
 $ php check_configuration.php

You should also execute the checker from a browser and fix the issues it might 
discover. That's because PHP can have a distinct php.ini configuration file for 
these two environments, with different settings.



4. Install



5. Apache VirtualHost sample

After installing RdvZ, you need to set up a VirtualHost for your Apache server.
Here is a sample file, don't forget to change the pathes :

[/etc/apache2/httpd.conf]
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>
  ServerName rdvz.localhost
  DocumentRoot "/home/symfony/rdvz/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "/home/symfony/rdvz/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>

  Alias /sf /home/symfony/rdvz/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf
  <Directory "/home/symfony/rdvz/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

[/etc/hosts]
127.0.0.1 rdvz.localhost

Of course this configuration only works on your local machine, you need to adapt
it in order to access your Apache server from the Internet.

Don't forget to reload your Apache server after setting up the VirtualHost.
