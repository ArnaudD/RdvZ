** Disclaimer :
The current version is still an alpha : there is no user documentation nor
built-in installer, although it will come rather quickly I hope. Developper
documentation will arrive soon too, and you can already read code comments.

1. Introduction
RdvZ is a web application developed by the Université d’Avignon et des Pays 
de Vaucluse which allows to create and manage meetings and to poll potential 
attendee avalibility. The application allows both anonymous and authenticated 
access (it can be either with MySQL or with a CAS server + LDAP or with a 
LDAP server alone), but whatever the access mode, everybody is able to vote 
without being authenticated.
